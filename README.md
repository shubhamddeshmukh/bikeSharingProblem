# Bike Problem
A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.

The company wants to know:
- Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
- How well those variables describe the bike demands

## General Information
The company wants to know:
- Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
- How well those variables describe the bike demands

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- The most affecting variable is temp
- renting in year 2019 is more than 2018
- summer, winter and Sep month are positvely correlated to bike rentals, company can promote and give some offers in         these time period
- Sunday, July and Mist + Cloudy weather is negatively correlated to bike rental, so company should give more and more       offers in this time period so that they can increase the rental.
